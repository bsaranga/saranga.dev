          {`ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Saranga, a full-stack software engineer with a strong command of the Microsoft ecosystem, especially .NET Core and C#. But I donâ€™t believe in being boxed in by tools or languages. Iâ€™m language-agnostic at heart and comfortable working across environments, from Unix-based systems to cross-platform tooling, with experience in Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, and beyond.

What matters to me most is writing clean, reliable, and maintainable code. I approach software engineering with a deep respect for fundamentals: clean architecture, separation of concerns, and test-driven development, applied pragmatically, not dogmatically.

Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve worked across the stack. Iâ€™ve refactored legacy codebases, built distributed systems, automated testing and deployment pipelines, and strengthened codebases with scalable patterns and meaningful tests. My goal isnâ€™t just to get things working, itâ€™s to make sure they stay working, with clarity and confidence.

This blog is where I share what I learn, build, and refine â€” from deep dives into .NET and system design, to thoughts on clean code, tooling, and how to think like a long-term engineer.

If you're into thoughtful, testable, and future-ready software, you're in the right place.`}
