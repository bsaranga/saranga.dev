`ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Saranga, a full-stack developer with a strong command of the Microsoft ecosystem, especially .NET Core and C#. 
Iâ€™m language-agnostic at heart and comfortable working across various languages, tools, and environments, I've got experience in Python, 
JavaScript, TypeScript, C, Rust, and Unix-based environments. What matters to me most is writing clean, reliable, and maintainable code. 
I approach software engineering with a deep respect for fundamentals: data-structures, algorithms, memory management, clean architecture, 
separation of concerns, and test-driven development, applied pragmatically, not dogmatically. Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve worked across 
several technology stacks. Iâ€™ve refactored legacy codebases, built distributed systems, automated testing and deployment pipelines, and 
strengthened codebases with scalable patterns and meaningful tests. My goal isnâ€™t just to get things working, itâ€™s to make sure they stay 
working, with clarity and confidence.`
