#### The Sunk Cost of Hyper Specialization
Consider the typical job listings for software engineers, where expertise in specific frameworks or languages like Spring Boot or JavaScript are highly sought after, often requiring ridiculously extensive experience, in some cases even 15+ years.

It’s fact that the field of software engineering has highly respected engineers who are masters of specific niches. However, this approach has overlooked the collaborative potential of engineers beyond technical realms. With the rise of code-generating Large Language Models (LLMs), this landscape is shifting, allowing for a change in the way we approach software engineering.

I’ve worked with many software product teams in the past and often times despite being a proficient master of C#, I often felt sidelined as my colleagues solely focused on this expertise, failing to recognize my capacity to make strategic decisions to meet customer requirements.

And because engineers are hired for their specific skills in a language or framework, they always get assigned to projects tailored to those specific abilities. Consequently, they often miss out on opportunities to explore technical domains beyond their current toolset.
