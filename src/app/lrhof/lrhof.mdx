### Learning Resources Hall Of Fame

This page contains my curated list of learning resources for developers who want to **level up** in their career.

##### 1. Hardware unAbstracted
[Hardware unAbstracted](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5QYOqmT-UChfM5HDZSVG-ucrnLjvUbrR) is a great playlist from the YouTube channel
[Calm Energy Bytes](https://www.youtube.com/@Calm_Energy). According to me the highlight of this playlist is a thoughtful, multi-part 
walkthrough of the seminal paper “What Every Programmer Should Know About Memory” by Ulrich Drepper. 
These videos unpack the intricacies of memory hierarchy, CPU-cache interactions, latency pitfalls, and practical strategies for writing 
performant code that aligns with real-world hardware behavior. The 3 videos distills one of the most dense and influential resources 
in systems programming into clear, digestible insights; making it accessible to both curious developers and seasoned engineers. 
Among other things, the playlist also includes explorations of the RAM-CPU relationship, a breakdown of the Intel 8008’s ALU, and grep.
